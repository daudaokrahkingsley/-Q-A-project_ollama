The equivalences of other qualifications including foreign ones are similarly established. For WAASCE candidates, the minimum entry requirements for admission to first degree programmes, prescribed by Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC), is aggregate 24.

      "Due to limited resources available, the University determines and approves quota for every programme and selects candidates to fill the spaces based on their aggregate. This means candidates must compete for the available space based on examination scores. The minimum aggregate used   to select candidates for a programme of study, within the minimum entry requirements of aggregate 24, is the Cut-off Aggregate. The Cut-off Aggregate is not predetermined; it may vary from year to year, based on the pass rate and the available space/resources for a programme.  The Cut-off Aggregates for programmes for the previous academic year’s admissions are published, here-below, to guide prospective applicants in their selection of programmes.
